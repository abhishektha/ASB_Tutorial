# Interactive Element Setup

# Interactive Element Setup

The following steps are requried by the tutorial leader before starting the interactive element. 

## 1. Fork Repository

Forking the repository creates a copy of the repository on your own GitHub account.
This is a great way for you to work on a copy of a project that you don't own. 
For this tutorial, forking the repository allows your group to work through the exercise in their own space.
You can read more information on forking [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

To fork the repository, click on the "Fork" button on the top right of the page. 

## 2. Invite collaborators

Add your collaborators to the project on your forked copy of the repository. 
Go to "Settings", then "Manage Access", then "Add Collaborators" to add collaborators to your copy of the repository. 

## 3. Open Issues

The MATLAB/Python/R scripts provided with this tutorial provide some easy bugs in the plotting functions that can be fixed by your collaborators, utilizing Git to keep track of changes. 

The bugs are listed below:
* Change Color of plots
* Change Line Style of plots
* Change Marker for plots
* Fix y-limit
* Fill in x- and y- axis labels
* Fill in state for subplot title

It is recommended to assign one bug to each collaborator to fix.
Bugs can be assigned through issues, go to the "Issues" tab on the top of your forked repository, and open a new issue for each bug.
Each issue can then be assigned to a collaborator. 

Collaborators will then be encouraged to make a new branch for the issue they are assigned, fix the bug, commit the change, and then create a pull request for the branch outlining their change.
